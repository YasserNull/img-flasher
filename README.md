# Img Flasher

**Img Flasher** allows you to flash, extract, unpack, and repack IMG files.

You can use the **Img Flasher** app or run the `imgf` command in the terminal.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:
Once you start flashing, you cannot stop the process. Be cautious, as flashing the wrong file can brick your device or cause a boot loop.

## App Features:

### 1. **Extract or Backup:**
You can extract IMG files from your phone (e.g., `boot.img`, `nvram.img`, `recovery.img`).

- To select a file, click the IMG or üìÄ icon.
- After clicking **Extract**, the files will be saved to `/storage/emulated/0/Download/ImgFlasher/`.

I also want to note that I developed this app using Sketchware Pro. I apologize for any errors or the simplicity of the interface, as I'm still gaining experience.
